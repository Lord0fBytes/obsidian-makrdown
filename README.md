# obsidian-markdown
JS Based Obsidian markdown interpreter for Webpages

### Forked from [casual-markdown](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown)

Using a base javascript file (credited by casual-markdown above) I tweaked it to allow for the unique markdown language that Obsidian uses. 
(for advacned use see the casual-markdown README for more info)

This will be part of a larger project to display Obsidian notes publically. You can create a `Public` folder in Obsidian and sync it to a server (I use syncthing) and the pages will be displayed in a webpage. 
All formatting handled by the js script.

Added Theme support for [draccula](https://draculatheme.com/) for now

### This is a work-in-progress app, but will be under active development

### TODO:
- [ ] Link support
- [ ] Image support optimization
- [ ] Better code blocks
- [ ] Task list support
